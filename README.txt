Pytweet Project:

A demo application that integrates Django, JQueryUI, and
Python-Twitter.

Getting Started:

Unzip the sample file, cd into the project directory,
and type in at the command line:

python manage.py runserver

Then point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/twitterPanel

You will need an active internet connection to retrieve your
twitter account information.

**Important**
This demo will not work "out of the box". You must run

>>>python manage.py syncdb

from the terminal. This will create a sqlite3 database
for managing sessions.
